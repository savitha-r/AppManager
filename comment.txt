* interface
	- the presentation/layout is plain and unorganized: hard to navigate (almost unusable)
	- it shouldn't be to hard/time consuming to use bootstrap 
	- "You do not have admin access to the ete Company.", but there are still links to manage resources
	- superadmin can't edit company user roles (blank)
	- admin interface has only "sign out" and "create company"
	- no file upload check
	-


* system design
	- no company creator
	- http://localhost:3000/2-8b15 is not clear (no path indication). note: this is not card reader we use to do

* specs
	- user can register inactive companies more than one!
